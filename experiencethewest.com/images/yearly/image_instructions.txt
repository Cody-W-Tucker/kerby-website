reduce size of images by 30% and save as png if transparent and jpeg if not transparent (compress if needed)
replace contents in psd templates located in experiencethewest.com/images/yearly and save to current year's +1 folder
make sure each final image is named the same as last years image
update folder links in html to current year +1

when finished move last year's folder to archive/old-images (this folder has correct web premissions to hide from public)

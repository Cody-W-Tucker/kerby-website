This site changes yearly, below you will find a list of expected changes and instructions on how to carry them out.

## Deployment

Github --> Local --> Release --> FTP client's Godaddy account.

Github: https://github.com/Cody-W-Tucker/kerby-website/

## Ideas for technical improvement.

- Enforce consistent image ratios to ensure images are the correct size. Size is set in HTML, should remove sizes in HTML and recreate in CSS. This will ensure images are always formated correctly and don't appear blurry.
- Uppdate to HTML5 standard.
  - Remove HTML structure and style with CSS.
  - Create HTML templates and serve with JS all repeated elements.
- Remove old and unused redirection rules in .htaccess
  - Remove the need to enter file extensions in the browser. (index.html --> index)
- Should load analytics script from separate script file for best practice.
- There are 3 photoshop templates located in images/yearly. These templates are used to recreate custom images used across the site. Ideally, we would recreate these custom images with CSS as they are images with text or images floated on top of one another.

# Image optimization instructions.

**This section gives guidance on how to reduce the size of images provided by the client.**  

1. The client will have several versions of every file, request the photoshop version of the images only.
2. Resize images to 30% and save as png if transparent and jpeg if not transparent (compress as needed.)
3. Retain image name as given.
4. Save into images/yearly/{current year +1}
5. Remove the previous year's folder to be saved on the client's local storage.
    - Include full-sized photoshop images.

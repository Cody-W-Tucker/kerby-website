This site changes yearly, below you will find a list of expected changes and instructions on how to carry them out.

## Ideas for technical improvement.

- Enforce consistent image ratios to insure images are correct size. Size is set in html, should remove sizes in html and recreate in css. This will insure images are always formated correctly and don't appear blurry.
- Uppdate to HTML5 standard.
    - Remove html structure and style with css.
    - Create html templates and serve with JS all repeated elements.

# Image optimization instructions.

1. Reduce size of images by 30% and save as png if transparent and jpeg if not transparent (compress if needed.)
2. Name final images the same as last years.
3. Save into images/yearly/{current year +1}
4. Update folder links in html to current year +1.
5. When finished remove previous year's folder to be saved on client's local storage.

1. Change 1 date to 2023.
